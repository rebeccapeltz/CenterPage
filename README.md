# Center Content on a Web Page

Two methods to center content on a web page.  The Box Model uses margins and margin, width, and text-alignment.  Flex Box uses flex, column direction, and align-items.

Both methods work, but there it is difficult to center the pre, code text such that it retains the format of the code.  This is because of the `text-align` property.  There are values that can be set for the `pre` section but they don't allow the contents of the code to keep its spacing.
